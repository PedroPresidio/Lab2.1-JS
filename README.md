# Lab2.1-JS

The idea behind what i did, was to change colors and shapes the closest to the 0 we got. I did not had many ideas for different shapes or scenarios, but I did the changed shapes and colors.
I have also implemented a check for error, in case there is no input from the photosensor, would print a message on the top left corner warning of the issue, to check if there is data being sent. It work pretty well because I was having a hard time fixing it, and it was key to understand where I was having that issue.
I was having issues with my triangle and resizing it after changing it to the circle or ball. So AI assited me to create a triangle that points forward up, everytime the range is greater than 680.
